<h1>
JAVA SOCKS Server</h1>
It is a SOCKS server written entirely in Java, which supports both SOCKS4
and SOCKS5 protocols. This software is distributed under GNU Lesser General Public
License, meaning that both binary and source code are freely available
and can be modified an distributed.
<p><font size=+0>I would not bother you with long list of things I'm not
responsible for. Let me just say, that you are using this program on your
own risk, and it is not me to blame if anything doesn't work as you expected.
I tried my best, but it is up to you to check if it works as you wish it
to, the source code is there, so you can correct whatever you don't like.</font>
<h2>
Update Information</h2>
Please visit the <a href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/jsocks>JSocks Project Page</a> for latest updates. The CVS update log should be most informative.
<br>
Latest packaged version is 1.01. Proxy have been rewised and there are some changes
to the <a href="SOCKSLib.html">Socks Library</a>. New features have been
added to the proxy server itself, well at least one
<ul>
<li>
Now it is possible to use this proxy from behind another proxy.</li>

<li>
Also proxy chaining is introduced, it allows you to configure the proxy
to connect through a series of proxies before reaching the desired host:
proxy1-> proxy2->...proxyN->desired_host. It is a strange feature but might
be useful in some situations.</li>
</ul>
Some bug fixes have been done, it is now possible to use ICQ with this
proxy server.

How to download</h2>

To download the latest binary and documentation packages, visit  the <a href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/jsocks/files/>JSocks project files</a> page.

<h2>
What this Server is good for?</h2>
Well, it is a not a commercial proxy server. It does not have plenty of
features like address caching. Authentication scheme is rather simplistic,
but can be extended, if you know how to program in Java. It is java application
after all, which gives platform independence but at the cost of performance.
But it is simple to install and use.
<p>It is assumed that the socks library itself is more useful to most developers,
rather than a simple server which uses the library. If you are a developer
and want your applications to have support for SOCKSv5 protocol, you might
find useful visiting <a href="SOCKSLib.html">Socks Library</a> page.
<h2>
SocksEcho</h2>
SocksEcho is another application which uses <tt>socks</tt> package. It
is GUI echo client, which is SOCKS aware, you can make and accept connections
through the proxy using this client. You can also send datagrams through
SOCKS5 proxy. I have used it a lot for testing. This application is also
included.
<h2>
How to Install</h2>
First download pre compiled class files, and unzip the socks_bin.zip this
will create a directory called socks. See README.html in this directory
for further instructions.
<h2>
Requirements</h2>
In order to run these application you will need Java Virtual Machine which
supports Java 1.1 or higher. I have tested it with jdk1.1.6 and jdk1.2.2
under Windows95 and on jdk1.1.5 under Solaris. Server application might
be able to run even under java 1.0, but I haven't tested this.
