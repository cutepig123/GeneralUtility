  Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
 
       Major Version
       Minor Version 
       Build Number
       Revision
 
  You can specify all the values or you can default the Revision and Build Numbers

/*
  In order to sign your assembly you must specify a key to use. Refer to the 
  Microsoft .NET Framework documentation for more information on assembly signing.
 
  Use the attributes below to control which key is used for signing. 
 
  Notes: 
    (*) If no key is specified, the assembly is not signed.
    (*) KeyName refers to a key that has been installed in the Crypto Service
        Provider (CSP) on your machine. KeyFile refers to a file which contains
        a key.
    (*) If the KeyFile and the KeyName values are both specified, the 
        following processing occurs:
        (1) If the KeyName can be found in the CSP, that key is used.
        (2) If the KeyName does not exist and the KeyFile does exist, the key 
            in the KeyFile is installed into the CSP and used.
    (*) In order to create a KeyFile, you can use the sn.exe (Strong Name) utility.
        When specifying the KeyFile, the location of the KeyFile should be
        relative to the project output directory which is
        %Project Directory%\obj\<configuration>. For example, if your KeyFile is
        located in the project directory, you would specify the AssemblyKeyFile 
        attribute as <assembly: AssemblyKeyFile("..\\..\\mykey.snk")>
    (*) Delay Signing is an advanced option - see the Microsoft .NET Framework
        documentation for more information on this.
