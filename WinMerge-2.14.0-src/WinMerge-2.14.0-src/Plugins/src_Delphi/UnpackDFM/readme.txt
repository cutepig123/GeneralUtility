UnpackDFM is a plugin for WinMerge which allows WinMerge to
compare and merge Delphi's binary dfm files.

The plugin does nothing if it is passed a text-based dfm
file. In this case, WinMerge will handle the comparison as
normal.

Written in and for Borland Delphi 4 - because all dfm files
are binary for this version of the compiler.

Requires the runtime library vcl40.bpl, which is part of
the Delphi 4 setup. This is deliberate - I have no way to
test the plugin on binary dfm files generated by higher
versions of Delphi. If you want to use this plugin for
DFM files from >Delphi 4, I'd recommend recompiling it
first.
