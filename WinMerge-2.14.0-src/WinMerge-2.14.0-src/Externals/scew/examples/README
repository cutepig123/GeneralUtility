SCEW Examples
=============

  This directory contains, as its name suggests, examples on how to
use the SCEW library. Here is the list of available examples:

  - scew_print           Prints a well-formed XML file.
  - scew_stream          XML streaming example.
  - scew_write           Creates a new XML file and writes it to a file

  Note that Windows support, for building SCEW examples, is found in
the 'win32' directory.
