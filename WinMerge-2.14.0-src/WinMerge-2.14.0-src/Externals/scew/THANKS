people have contributed to SCEW by reporting problems, suggesting
improvements, or submitting actual code. Here is a list of these
people. Help me keep it complete and exempt of errors.

  usual, he has helped me in many other ways. Thanks jao!

  also provided the initial builds on Windows, and many more.

* Sanzo Miyazawa submitted code to improve performance in element and
  attribute iteration in first releases.

* Neil Harvey has contributed the pkg-config file.

* Carlos Carrasco helped a lot in the debugging and testing phases of
  initial releases. Those nigths at IRC were really great. Thanks!

  boring implementation thoughts of SCEW readers/writers.
