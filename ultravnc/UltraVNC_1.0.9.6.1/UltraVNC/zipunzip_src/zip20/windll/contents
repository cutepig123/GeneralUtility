  windll16.def   definition file for 16-bit Zip DLL
  windll32.def   definition file for 32-bit Zip DLL
  windll.c       Contains the entry point for the DLL, "fake" printing,
                 and password functions.
  windll.h       header file for both 16 and 32-bit DLLs.
  zipver.h       versioning information for resource file, and also
                 used by WiZ application itself.
  windll.rc      resource file for both 16 and 32-bit DLLs
  windll.txt     simplistic explanation of how to use DLL.
  structs.h      header file used by both the dll and by WiZ which defines
                 several structures passed to the dll.
  example.c      a very simplistic example of how to load the dll, and make
                 a call into it.
  example.h      header file for example.c

  visualc\dll <dir> contains Visual C++ 6.0 project and make files for
                    zip32 dll.
  visualc\lib <dir> contains Visual C++ 6.0 project and make files for
                    zip32 static library.
  vb          <dir> new version of the Visual Basic dll frontend example,
                    many bugfixes and enhancements.
  csharp      <dir> example of using zip32.dll with csharp, but experimental
                    so see readmeCS.txt in that directory.

The dll and static library port was developed and tested under Microsoft
Visual C++ 6.0.  The former support for the Borland C++ compilers has been
discontinued; bcc-compiled DLLs are not universally usable because of their
requirements for special Borland runtime libs (and probably some calling
convention specialities).
Compilation for 16-bit Windows 3.x is no longer supported.
